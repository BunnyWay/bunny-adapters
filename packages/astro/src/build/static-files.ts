 * which Cloudflare Pages and Netlify read too, and it reads nothing shaped like
 * Astro. So the two things a static Astro build cannot express on its own -- a
 * redirect with a real status, and a response header -- are written here.
 *
 * Only the subset both hosts agree on is written: one rule per line, a path, a
 * target, and a status. `!` after the status forces the rule over a file at the
 * same path, which is what a redirect needs: Astro also writes a meta-refresh
 * page there, and that page would answer 200 and send the visitor on with a
 * `<meta>` tag instead of a `Location` header.
