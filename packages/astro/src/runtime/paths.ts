 *
 * The rule is: decode exactly once, then treat the result as literal text, and
 * encode it again when it goes back into a URL. Decoding twice is what lets a
 * traversal through, because each layer filters what the layer after it decodes.

 * URL, so a segment that kept it would climb out of the zone later.
