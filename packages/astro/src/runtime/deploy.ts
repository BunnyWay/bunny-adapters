/**
 * Which deploy this script is.
 *
 * `bunny deploy` uploads each build to its own folder in the storage zone, and
 * writes the folder's name into the top of the bundle:
 *
 * ```js
 * globalThis.__BUNNY_DEPLOY__ = { id: "a1b2c3d4", assetPrefix: "deploys/a1b2c3d4" };
 * ```
 *
 * So the code and the files it was built against cannot drift apart. Publishing
 * an earlier release restores that release's prefix in the same operation, which
 * is what makes a rollback one step.
 *
 * A hand-rolled deploy sets nothing, and the prefix is empty. The script then
 * reads the zone root, which is where an upload without deploys puts the build.
